# Week 1: GitHub Workflow Mastery

## Workflow

In this week's entry, I will document my practical work in mastering GitHub's workflow tools as part of my coursework. The main objectives were to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing GitHub's workflow tools and successfully executing the required operations, which include:

- Accepting a task from the project backlog
- Updating task information appropriately
- Maintaining the task board accordingly
- Completing development tasks on feature branches
- Validating work against the Definition of Done (DoD)


### Task Workflow

**1. Accepting a Task from the Project Backlog**

To begin, I accessed our team project's backlog and selected a task, which will involve C# and .NET MAUI by building a test app using an SQLite database.
As explained in my last entry, the Backlog is made in Github Projects

**2. Updating Task Information**

I ensured that the task's details were up to date and relevant to my work. This involved clarifying the objectives and expectations for the task.

**3. Task Board Management**

I actively participated in maintaining the task board by moving the selected task to the "In Development" column to signal that I had started working on it.

**4. Completing Development Tasks on Feature Branches**

I created a feature branch specifically for this task, allowing me to isolate my work from the main codebase while working on the SQLite database integration.

**5. Checking Work Against Definition of Done (DoD)**

After some development, I reviewed my work against the Definition of Done (DoD) to verify that it met the required criteria and was ready for integration into the main codebase. As it was not ready yet, I did not push the changes and waited until next practical to practice coding


## Reflection

This week's practical work allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of GitHub's workflow tools and their importance in collaborative software development. However, I did face some challenges, such as initially navigating the project backlog efficiently. To overcome this, I sought guidance from my team members, who provided valuable assistance.

Regarding the current process, I believe it is generally effective but could benefit from clearer task descriptions in the backlog and improved guidance on the Definition of Done. Additionally, streamlining the task board configuration for enhanced intuitiveness would contribute to a smoother workflow.

In conclusion, mastering GitHub's workflow tools is pivotal in ensuring a successful and collaborative development process. As I continue to work on the course, I look forward to refining and improving these processes for future iterations.
